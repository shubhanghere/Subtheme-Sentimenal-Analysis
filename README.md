# Subtheme-Sentimenal-Analysis
This task involves analyzing reviews to identify and classify sentiments related to specific aspects. For example, in a garage review, subthemes like "incorrect tyres sent" (negative), "garage service" (positive), and "wait time" (negative) are identified. The goal is to develop a method to extract these subthemes and their sentiments from text.
